# Teddy
3rd year group project. For this game, I was responsible with modelling and animating the characters, as well as designing the environment

MAIN CHARACTER

The above character represents the asset used in the game for the player, called Teddy. Teddy is his ownerâ€™s favourite toy, and he is responsible of protecting the owner from nightmares and terrors. The character is modelled and animated in Blender.
The model has 3 animation states: idle, running, sword fighting.

For this level, which is a demo level, there is only one type of enemies: the spiders.

There is only one weapon available for this level, a sword that can be acquired from the chest in front of the house, at the start of the level. This sword can also be crafted by using resources such as wood and metal.

LEVEL DESIGN

The level design proposed for this subsystem is a simple environment, their purpose is to guide the player successfully throughout the level and not confuse the player. Various elements such as the post-processing effects that have been applied on the skybox, the moving grass, the low poly water, etc. fit the theme of the game and manage to achieve a dreamy, foggy environment that suggests that the player is transported into a dream fantasy world. Regarding the reliability of the system, the environment is complex, yet simplistic, being able to run the level at a decent frame rate.
